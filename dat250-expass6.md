Assignment 3 - Integration of Back-End and Front-End
During the third assignment of DAT250, I encountered challenges connecting the back-end with the front-end due to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issues. These issues were primarily related to configuring the appropriate headers to allow requests from the front-end application to interact with the back-end services.

Resolution: I successfully addressed the CORS issues by configuring the necessary CORS settings on the server-side, which involved updating the server's response headers to permit requests from the client domain. This configuration ensured that the front-end application could communicate seamlessly with the back-end services, allowing for proper data exchange and functionality.
