#Assigment 2
I encountered recurring issues while using Bruno, as it frequently got stuck during the creation of tests.
This problem disrupted the workflow, causing delays in the testing process. Despite multiple attempts to resolve it, the issue persisted throughout my usage. 
Further investigation into Bruno's stability might be needed.
To resolve the issue, I would periodically close and reopen the application, which allowed everything to function correctly again. 
This workaround helped mitigate the problem, although it was a temporary solution.
